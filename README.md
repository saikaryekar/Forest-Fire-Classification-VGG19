# Forest Fire Classification with VGG19

This project aims to detect and classify forest fires using deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG-19 convolutional neural network model. The model is trained to analyze images and accurately predict whether they contain signs of a forest fire or not. 

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pre-trained weights from the VGG-19 model on ImageNet for feature extraction.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances the training dataset through image augmentation techniques for improved model generalization.
- **Binary Classification:** Classifies images into two categories: fire or non-fire, facilitating quick decision-making.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Flexibility to experiment with hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate for optimal performance.
- **Validation Metrics:** Monitors and displays validation loss and accuracy during training for model evaluation.
- **Loss Curves:** Visualizes the training and validation loss curves over epochs to understand the model's learning progress.
- **Predictions and Evaluation:** Generates predictions on test and validation sets, providing insights into model performance.
